    <h1>Rose Games Online Documentation</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Rose Games Online is a website which lets users create and share games made in a limited form of Javascript. The
        website utilizes server-side code, Canvas, and WebSocket connections to achieve this.<br>
        This document will go over the capabilites and limits of Rose Games Online.</p><br>
    <section>
        <h2>Capabilities and Limits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The games on this website supports the latest NodeJS-based ES6 Javascript functionality to the fullest,
                except as listed below.
            <li>The programmer is responsible for error/syntax checking and correction</li>
            </li>
            <li>The game is played on a canvas with a viewable space with coordinates (X,Y)=(0,0) at the top left edge,
                to (X,Y)=(1920, 1080) at the bottom right edge (positive X left to right, positive Y top to bottom). The
                canvas is set to a white background at the start of every game.</li>
            <li>The games have access to functions and classes, described in detail in "reference".</li>
            <li>The following keywords, methods, functions, and classes ARE supported: <a
                    href="allowedKeywords.json">allowedKeywords.json</a></li>
            <li>If a banned keyword has been found in the code, code saving will stop and an error message will show.
            </li>
            <li>Most NodeJS and DOM Javascript, as well as web APIs which may or may not be supported on web browsers,
                and some advanced functionality such as multithreading, has been banned from any game.</li>
            <li>The modification or redefinition of any provided class or function is not allowed (note: as of now the
                website does not check for this, although it should, so just don't do it pls)</li>
            <li>The following keywords, methods, functions, and classes ARE NOT supported: <a
                    href="bannedKeywordsAndAPIs.json">bannedKeywordsAndAPIs.json</a></li>
            <li><b>In order to ensure games run smoothly on the server, any infinite/long term loop (including waiting
                    for inputs) MUST include a delay. Not doing so will result in the game freezing when running!</b>
            </li>
            <li>There is a set limit to the amount of memory and the size of the stack for your game. For most working
                games, they should be well within the limit.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2>Reference</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>time</h3>
                <p>time is a static class which gives functionality for delays, and keeping track of milliseconds since
                    game start.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>time.start</b>: returns Date object set to when the game started running (Date.now())</li>
                    <li><b>time.time</b>: returns Date.now()-time.start, the elapsed time since the game started</li>
                    <li><b>time.wait(ms)</b>: Causes the game to wait ms milliseconds before running the next line.
                    <li>Note: time.wait(ms) is thread-locking. Rose Games Online allows other time-based Javascript
                        functionality such as setInterval.</li>
            </li>
        </ul>

            <h3>cursor</h3>
            <p>cursor is a function which allows the game to change the user's cursor look while it's on the game

            <ul>
                <li><b>inputs().resetInputs()</b>: Sets all inputs back to values of 0</li>
                <li><b>inputs().hasFocus</b>: Returns true if the user has the game window focused (i.e. hasn't clicked out).
